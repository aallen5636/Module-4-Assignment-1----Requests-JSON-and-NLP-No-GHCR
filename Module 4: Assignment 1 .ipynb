      "Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n",
      "Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\n",
      "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n",
      "    Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n",
